# **DailyJournalAI**

Welcome to **DailyJournalAI**, a project that combines the power of **Python**, **Flask**, and **AI** (specifically, large language models or **LLMs**) to help users maintain a journaling habit that benefits mental wellness. With daily AI-generated prompts delivered straight to your inbox, this project aims to make journaling as easy and reflective as possible. Built using modern Python tools, this project handles everything from generating thoughtful prompts to managing journal entries and responses via email. It's more than just a coding project—it's a tool for mindful self-reflection.

## **Key Features**

- **AI-Generated Prompts**: Integrated with **OpenAI's GPT-based models** to generate meaningful and personalized daily journal prompts.
- **Flask Web Framework**: Our lightweight, Python-powered backend that handles everything from managing user prompts to sending email.
- **Email Integration**: Custom email delivery with automatic prompt sending and response tracking via `smtplib` and `imaplib`. We make sure every email has its own unique **Message-ID** for precise tracking.
- **SQLAlchemy ORM**: Seamless database management using SQLAlchemy, so all your journal entries, prompts, and responses are safely stored.
- **Dockerized Setup**: A complete **Docker** setup makes deployment and environment configuration simple and hassle-free.
- **Automated Testing**: Continuous Integration through **GitHub Actions** ensures that everything works like clockwork on every push or pull request.

## **Tech Stack**

- **Programming Language**: Python (3.9+)
- **Framework**: Flask
- **Database**: SQLite for local dev, PostgreSQL for production (because, why not?)
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy
- **AI Integration**: GPT-based **LLMs** from OpenAI (because we're modern like that)
- **Email Handling**: Good old `smtplib` and `imaplib` (for sending and receiving emails)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub (because teamwork makes the dream work)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (to make sure everything stays solid with automated tests)
- **Containerization**: Docker (because deployments should be easy)

## **Future Improvements**

Some cool ideas we’re excited about for the future:

- Integrating a cloud database (like **PostgreSQL** on AWS or GCP).
- Adding AI-based sentiment analysis to assess journal responses.
- Creating a slick **React** or **Next.js** frontend for more user interaction.
- Deploying the app on **AWS**, **GCP**, or **Azure** for scalability.
